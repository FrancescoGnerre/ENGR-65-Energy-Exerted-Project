# ENGR-65-Energy-Exerted-Project
This project is an extra credit assignment for the UC Merced class ENGR 65, circuit theory. It discusses how to maximize the energy output of resistors, inductors, and capacitors. 

There are two files other than the README. The first is 'Francesco Gnerre - Extra Credit Project.pdf', and exists to give context to 'FrancescoGnerreExtraCreditProject.slx'.
